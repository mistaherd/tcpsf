# Introduction
In the repository my aim is for the following:
1. Learn CMAKE
2. Learn CI_CD
3. Use areans as buffers 
the aim of  this command is to send files across a network (whcih is another project) where the user passes  in the path or  its like a treefinder,each arugement that can be passed will multi way to display /view them 

# Usage 
this is a cli tool made in tandem with the meshnetwork project  the primary goal of this cli  is to learn about the space with some high view of how some open source build thier codebase in c. this mini project  does not aim to be perfect or have any implementation  connect to the cloud as that is  out of scope of the proejct this is  primarly for my own curiosity and nothing else
